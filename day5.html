						<p>After breakfast head to Langza which is the 2nd highest motorable village after Komic and is home to Fossil search in the country.
 						<p>If you are lucky then you shall surely find some beautiful fossils while you take a stroll here.
						<p>To make it a little more interesting at this altitude, the interested ones can hike from Langza to Komic via a small stop at Hikkim.
						<p>In order not to forget our loved ones, visit the world’s highest post office in Hikkim and post a few post cards to your loved ones.
						<p>Head to your last point for the day, Komic and enjoy the spectacular view of snow capped peaks around over a cup of tea and chat with the monks.
						<p>The monastery in Komic is functional in winters when temperatures dip down to -30 degrees and roads get blocked
						<p>Then head back to Langza for a home stay with a local family. The life in Spiti might be harsh but each and every aspect of it has a cozy side and you will feel that while sharing space with a local family.
